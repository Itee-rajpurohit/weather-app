# weather-app
The weather app, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a user-friendly program that provides accurate, real-time weather information through an API, offering a seamless user experience and reliable updates.
This is a simple web page that was created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can use the search bar to enter the name of the location whose weather needs to be determined.
Errors will occur if there are any spelling mistakes or other issues that the api is unable to identify. To receive the right results, you must search without any grammatical errors. In this particular case, we used an OpenWeatherMap api.
